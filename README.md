# Multiclass-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project leverages a sequential Keras model to categorize tweets related to COVID-19 into five distinct sentiment classes. The model employs GloVe word embeddings and a Bidirectional LSTM architecture for accurate sentiment analysis. The goals is to develop a strong sentiment analysis model to precisely categorize the sentiment of diverse tweets.
