A sequential Keras model, incorporating GloVe word embeddings and a Bidirectional LSTM layer, is implemented to classify COVID-19 tweets into five sentiment categories.

Multiclass Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP tools and Deep Learning
This project implements a deep learning model to classify the sentiments of tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic into 5 categories. The model is built, drawing inspiration from architectures like Bidirectional LSTM and includes word embeddings from GloVe. The aim is to create a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies sentiments across various tweets.
